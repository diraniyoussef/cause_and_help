# SaluteAndCause
A social interaction app based on Google map.

using the map (you must be knowledgeable about key map and so, in order to compile it on your android studio), an user may upload in his own location a statement (a salute or a cause) so that any other user using the app can see the statement. The statement can be made to be seen only within a circle, not beyond, or it may be made to be seen publicly.
